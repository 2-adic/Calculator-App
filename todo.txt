General:
    - "Cannot find reference 'connect' in 'pyqtSignal | pyqtSignal | function'" is a benign warning

Bugs:
    - When deleting multiple variables at once, some variables in the multi area are still showing up
        - Currently it seems to only happen when a variable is inside another variable, and everything is deleted from the textbox

    - When using tab to go to the next variable, it sometimes skips to the textbox
        - How it should work (in each step the user presses tab), it should loop as shown: text box -> variable 1 -> variable 2 -> variable n -> text box
        - Give the user a way to still type a tab in the text box (maybe mac: option + tab, Windows: 'not sure yet' + tab)

    - If the user is in a variable box while their mouse is on top of a variable text box, their mouse flashes between two different cursor shapes
        - Solution: when typing is detected, hide the cursor until the user moves their mouse again

    - LaTeX answer image still clips outside the answer box in specific circumstances
        - Bug does not happen on Windows, only on macOS (not sure why)
        - Ex: x + 7
        - This should be fixed, but testing on macOS is needed

    - Windows flash open and close while typing in the text box (when spamming enter, or pressing multiple keys at the same time)
        - Not sure why this happens
        - Find a way to stop these windows from generating
        - Does not happen on macOS, only Windows 10

    - Variable labels become too compacted and blocks each other's view
        - Only happens on macOS

    - Fix the rendering of mod
        - Ex: mod(x, y) renders as xmody

    - Copying the answer as an image does not allow it to be pasted as a file in file explorer
        - Could not find a fix for this

    - Word wrapping for the answer box only works if spaces are present
        - Causes long instances of multiplication to not wrap
            - Ex: a*b*c*d*e...
            - May want to add spaces between multiplication symbols (not sure if functionality is wanted yet)
                - Ex: a*b*c -> a * b * c
                - string.replace('*', ' * ')

    - macOS only bugs:

        - Maximize button on macOS keeps its hovering color after it is pressed

        - When opening the settings while he main window is full screened leads to glitchy behavior

        - Cannot blur the window background

Future Features:
    - Need shadowing for the sides of the window (for Windows)

    - Add window's snap functionality
        - Based on research, it does not seem possible to enable
            - May need to create the feature from scratch

    - Animation for minimizing functionality (for Windows)

    - Plus minus (±)
        - Ex, x = 2:
            - When in exact form:        5x ± 1 -> (5*2) ± 1 -> 10 ± 1
            - When in approximate form:  5x ± 1 -> 5x + 1 -> (5*2) + 1 -> 10 + 1 -> 11  (Displays both answers somehow)
                                                -> 5x - 1 -> (5*2) - 1 -> 10 - 1 -> 9

    - Represent functions somehow
        - Visually distinguish functions from other symbols
            - Current options:
                - Use italics
                - Use colored text
            - This is to prevent confusion of mixing up implicit multiplication and function names
                - Ex: if there was a function named "daf" the user may try to implicitly multiply "d*a*f" in an expression (due to not knowing it was a function), Ex: "daf + 2 - x"

    - Add pin feature for variables, so they don't get removed while its active

    - Change the font of the LaTeX image

    - Add settings:
        - Add rgb settings for changing the colors of text / background / borders / etc
        - Radio button border radius
            - Option between a circle and a squircle

    - Add a unit converter section

Before Beta:

    - Angle Unit setting:
        - Currently it works, but the answer needs to be checked after the expression is solved. If degrees are used, then the angle needs to be changed to display degrees.

    - Add more error detection

    - Fix macOS bugs
