General:
    - "Cannot find reference 'connect' in 'pyqtSignal | pyqtSignal | function'" is a benign warning

Bugs:
    - When deleting multiple variables at once, some variables in the multi area are still showing up
        - Currently it seems to only happen when a variable is inside another variable, and everything is deleted from the textbox

    - When using tab to go to the next variable, it sometimes skips to the textbox
        - How it should work (in each step the user presses tab), it should loop as shown: text box -> variable 1 -> variable 2 -> variable n -> text box
        - Give the user a way to still type a tab in the text box (maybe mac: option + tab, Windows: 'not sure yet' + tab)

    - App crashes from a lot of things
        - Need to use more try except blocks
        - More raises need to be used to account for common user errors
        - Crashes when:
            - User inputs ".." and clicks the answer button
            - Integration is with respect to variable A, and A is also defined as a value
                - Ex: integrate(x, x)   And the users sets x = 2
                - Not sure what to do about this because this doesn't happen in mathematics
                - Maybe make it if any value is entered for variable A, then an error pops up for the user

    - If the user is in a variable box while their mouse is on top of a variable text box, their mouse flashes between two different cursor shapes
        - Solution: when typing is detected, hide the cursor until the user moves their mouse again

    - LaTeX answer image still clips outside the answer box in specific circumstances
        - Bug does not happen on Windows, only on macOS (not sure why)
        - Ex: x + 7
        - This should be fixed, but testing on macOS is needed

    - Windows flash open and close while typing in the text box (when spamming enter, or pressing multiple keys at the same time)
        - Not sure why this happens
        - Find a way to stop these windows from generating
        - Does not happen on macOS, only Windows 10

    - Variable labels become too compacted and blocks each other's view
        - Only happens on macOS

    - e^n for n != 1 gives a decimal value when the symbol is supposed to be used
        - This is caused by the __custom_approx function

    - Fix the rendering of mod
        - Ex: mod(x, y) renders as xmody

Future Features:
    - Need shadowing for the sides of the window (for Windows)

    - Add a settings section
        - Option to toggle between radians and degrees

    - Add window's snap functionality
        - Based on research, it does not seem possible to enable
            - May need to create the feature from scratch

    - Animation for minimizing functionality (for Windows)

    - Plus minus (±)
        - Ex, x = 2:
            - When in exact form:        5x ± 1 -> (5*2) ± 1 -> 10 ± 1
            - When in approximate form:  5x ± 1 -> 5x + 1 -> (5*2) + 1 -> 10 + 1 -> 11  (Displays both answers somehow)
                                                -> 5x - 1 -> (5*2) - 1 -> 10 - 1 -> 9

    - Represent functions like cos() with italics
        - Might solve this problem another way without the use of color (not sure yet)
        - Make the "cos" highlight if the program detects it may be a function
            - If the user does an input (click + control, not sure), cos turns into italics and is considered a function instead of c*o*s
        - May want a font where the italics are the same width as the normal characters

    - Need to test if circularly defined variables are being detected every time
        - Need to give error for all cases where this occurs (not giving an error at all atm)

    - Add pin feature for variables, so they don't get removed while its active

    - Change the font of the LaTeX image

    - Add more functions

Before Beta:

    - Add all stylesheets to another .py file

    - Implement a way for settings to be saved through a txt file

    - Fill the settings window with settings:
        - Option to toggle between radians and degrees
            - Currently it works, but the answer needs to be checked after the answer is solved. If degrees are used, then the angle needs to be changed to display degrees.

        - Add rgb settings for changing the colors of text / background / borders / etc

        - Apply Button:
            - Need to somehow stop settings from changing before the apply button is pressed
                - Specifically the non-color settings (since the color settings don't apply until the button is pressed)

    - Add word wrapping to the answer button for when long errors are being displayed

    - Fix the vertical spacing in the notations tab
        - may not fix since the user cannot tell anything is wrong with it
            - it looks normal due to the amount of math functions below the symbols section

    - Add more error detection

    - Test on macOS
