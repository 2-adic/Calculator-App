General:
    - "Cannot find reference 'connect' in 'pyqtSignal | pyqtSignal | function'" is a benign warning

Bugs:
    - When deleting multiple variables at once, some variables in the multi area are still showing up
        - Currently it seems to only happen when a variable is inside another variable, and everything is deleted from the textbox

    - Implicit multiplication before a decimal is not working
        - Ex:
            - x.1 -> x(1/10): should be x*(1/10)
        - Not sure if this functionality is wanted anymore
        - x.1 seems as an incorrect way to write this out, check how other calculators handle this case

    - When using tab to go to the next variable, it sometimes skips to the textbox
        - How it should work (in each step the user presses tab), it should loop as shown: text box -> variable 1 -> variable 2 -> variable -> n -> text box
        - give the user a way to still type a tab in the text box (maybe mac: option + tab, Windows: 'not sure yet' + tab)

    - App crashes when user inputs ".." and clicks the answer button

    - If the user in a variable box while their mouse is on top of a variable text box, the mouse flashes between two different cursor shapes
        - Solution: when typing is detected, hide the cursor until the user moves their mouse again

    - LaTeX answer image still clips outside the answer box in specific circumstances
        - Bug does not happen on Windows, only on macOS (not sure why)
        - Ex: x + 7

    - LaTeX image has poor cropping
        - Create a custom function that crops the image (make sure the original rendered image is not cropped)

    - Implicit multiplication gives an error when the number comes after the variable
        - Ex: x8 should give (x)*8, but instead gives (x)8

    - Windows flash open and close while typing in the text box (when spamming enter, or pressing multiple keys at the same time)
        - Not sure why this happens
        - Find a way to stop these windows from generating

Future Features:
    - Need shadowing for the sides of the window (for Windows)

    - Add a settings section
        - Option to toggle commas; 1,000,000 <-> 1000000
        - Option to toggle between radians and degrees

    - Add window's snap functionality
        - Find a way to do it

    - Animation for minimizing functionality (for Windows)

    - Plus minus (±)
        - Ex, x = 2:
            - When in exact form:        5x ± 1 -> (5*2) ± 1 -> 10 ± 1
            - When in approximate form:  5x ± 1 -> 5x + 1 -> (5*2) + 1 -> 10 + 1 -> 11  (Displays both answers somehow)
                                                -> 5x - 1 -> (5*2) - 1 -> 10 - 1 -> 9

    - Represent functions like cos() with italics
        - Might solve this problem another way without the use of color (not sure yet)
        - Make the "cos" highlight if the program detects it may be a function
            - If the user does an input (click + control, not sure), cos turns into italics and is considered a function instead of c*o*s
        - May want a font where the italics are the same width as the normal characters

    - Need to test if circularly defined variables are being detected every time
        - Need to give error for all cases where this occurs (not giving an error at all atm)

    - Add pin feature for variables, so they don't get removed while its active

    - Use "solve" from functions.py to solve the user's questions from the text box

    - Change the font of the LaTeX image
